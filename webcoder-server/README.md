# Usage

* Build (but not run) the server: `npm run build`
* Start (and build) the server: `npm start`
* Test the server: `npm test`
* Run tests whenever source changes: `npm run watch:test`
* Run tests, rebuild, and restart server whenever source changes: `npm run watch:start`

If you're doing development, `npm run watch:start` is probably what you want.

If you just want to run the server, `npm start` is probably what you want.
