Edit code on a remote server in your browser.

The goal of this project is to let you edit source code for projects living on a
remote server. You shouldn't need to install a bunch of tools on your computer just to 
edit code hosted on another server (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.). Instead, wouldn't it be nice
if you could just visit a webpage and write some code?

There's still a lot of work to be done - right now you can just browse through your
source file system - open folders and see what files are in them. You can't view/edit
the contents of files yet.

The backend is a Node/Express server. Right now it just responds to /ls/<PATH> with a JSON
blob describing the (shallow) contents of the file.

The front-end is React/Flux, and use the /ls/ endpoint to implement a "Folder Browser" - you can
see the files and folders inside your source directory, though you can't open them yet.

## TODO

There's many more things to do, but here's the next steps:

* Add flux support (inital work done, but needs some cleanup)
* Add some tests for flux code
* ES6-ify react code (turn Filetype into a class, etc.)
* Query server for folder contents
* Get eslint working on frontend
* Figure out jsdoc (or something like it)
* Make setting up the localsettings.js file part of install flow
