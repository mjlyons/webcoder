The goal of this project is to let you edit source code for projects living on a
remote server. You shouldn't need to install a bunch of tools on your computer just to 
edit code hosted on another server (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.). Instead, wouldn't it be nice
if you could just visit a webpage and write some code?

There's still a lot of work to be done - right now you can just browse through your
source file system - open folders and see what files are in them. You can't view/edit
the contents of files yet.

The backend is a Node/Express server. Right now it just responds to /ls/<PATH> with a JSON
blob describing the (shallow) contents of the file.

The front-end is React/Flux, and use the /ls/ endpoint to implement a "Folder Browser" - you can
see the files and folders inside your source directory, though you can't open them yet.

## TODO

There's many more things to do, but here's the next steps:

* Authenticate users (right now anyone could just modify code)
* Fast fuzzy filename search (ctrl-p style)
* Do more to not let you lose unsaved changes
* Testing/cleanup
